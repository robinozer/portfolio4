# Django Restaurant Booking System #

## Purpose of the project ##
This is a web-based application that allows users to book a table at a restaurant. Users can create an account, log in, and then make, modify, or cancel a booking for a particular date and time.


## Features ##

![SCREENSHOT OF FLOWCHART]()

__User account creation and login system for external users__

__Once logged in, a user can create new bookings, modify existing bookings, and cancel bookings__
-   Prompts user to input valid form data.

__Input validation__
-	Prompts user to input valid form data.

__Admin dashboard for site owners to view and manage all bookings__
- Admin accepts bookings, and can change and delete bookings and users.

## Future features ##

- At the moment a user can request a booking at any time and date in the future. A feature to implement would be to prevent bookings outside of the restaurant's opening hours.
- When a user enters an invalid number of guests for a new booking, they get an error alert prompting them to enter a valid number of guests. This happens after form submission and clears the form, making the user have to re-enter all information. 
- The home page can display a menu, information about the restaurant, a picture, opening hours and more to make the experience more lively.
- The system can allow for multiple table occupancies.
- The system can automatically prevent a user from making a booking at the same date and time as one of their other bookings.
